            <p>Hello,I am Tahmidul Alam Rakin.I want to be a web developer.There are many things that make me passionate
                about web development.. The major thing that dragged me into web development is to look at my code
                changes
                in an instance and deciding or improving my code. Its highly practical looking at the immediate chanes
                that
                happen on your webpage and fix them accordingly.
